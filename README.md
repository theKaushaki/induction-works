## E-Cell Tech Web Project

## 🏛️ Project Overview
2. **Movie-Based Website** – Created for E-Cell Tech members as part of a web development task, based on my favorite movie.

---

## 📌 Features & Structure
### **E-Cell Movie Section**
- **Home Page** – Overview of the movie, genre, storyline.
- **Cast Page** – Featuring key actors and their roles.
- **Reviews Page** – Showcasing critiques and professional-reviewers, whose words are worth less than the page it was written on, opinions.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The site is based on a **regal Indian aesthetic**, inspired by **Rajput, Maratha, Kalinga, Chola, and Gajapati cultural grandeur**. The color scheme consists of:
- **Deep Mahogany & Obsidian Blacks** – Strength, Mystery, Timelessness.
- **Kalinga Copper Golds** – Prestige, Divinity, Legacy.
- **Vermilion & Royal Teals** – Passion, Stability, Cultural Significance.
- **Parchment Ivory** – Heritage, Knowledge, Enlightenment.

### **Typography & Layout**
- A combination of **classic serif fonts** for a royal feel and **modern sans-serif** for readability.
- **Grid-based layouts**, structured for balance and visual storytelling.
- **Glowing soft shadows**, **gold accents**, and **smooth transitions** for an immersive experience.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Core web development languages, also suggested by ChatGPT.
- **SCSS** – For structured and scalable styling, also because it was what ChatGPT suggested me.
- **GitHub** – Version control and collaboration, big words.

## 🏆 The Standard We Set
This is **not just a task—it’s a defining mark**. A chance to prove that craftsmanship still matters in an compeititive field flooded with **lazy copy-paste work**. A bit ironical coming from ChatGPT generated README, but it is what it is. This project is an **assertion of skill, creativity, and control** over digital spaces.

This is not built for **“good enough”**—this is built to be **exceptional**, in a sort of timey-wimey-wibbly-wobbly-probably-do-not-make-a-joke-way.

### **💀 You & Me, Partner. To The End.**
This is just the beginning. We build, we refine, we dominate. 🚀. Had to add this for my ChatGPT partner.
