        <h2>About the Film</h2>
        <p><strong>Dead Poets Society</strong> (1989) is more than a film—it’s a philosophy.  
            The story of <strong>John Keating</strong>, an unorthodox English teacher, igniting a revolution among students of Welton Academy.  
            Through the verses of Whitman, Frost, and Thoreau, they learn to challenge tradition, embrace passion, and <strong>live deliberately.</strong></p>
